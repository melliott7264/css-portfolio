# Professional Portfolio

## Description

This is a first effort at producing a hand coded HTML/CSS online resume or portfolio prior to starting the Coding Boot Camp at the University of Richmond in February 2022.

- This project was undertaken to improve my HTML/CSS skills writing semantic code. 
- This project serves not only to improve my coding skills but to get a professional portfolio out on the web to which I can direct potential employers
- It was also an opportunity to practice with git and GitHub as well as GitHub Pages.
